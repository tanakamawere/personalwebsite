<p>I have been listening to this man’s podcast and he says in the last year he made “mistakes.”
I have long believed that some mistakes that I am making in life are because I am a 22 year old.</p>

<p>This man is 79 and says he is still making “mistakes”.</p>

<p>Maybe it is part of the human condition.</p>
