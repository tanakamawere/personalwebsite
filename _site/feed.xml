We domestos them dead. And bacteria is part of what we call germs. But it seems very odd that the same bacteria we kill outside our bodies is also responsible for keeping us well inside.</p>

<p>So let’s start with what they are, what they do, why they are important to us, what we can do to keep them happy (all 38 trillion of them) and as a bonus, highlight the differences between <strong>prebiotic</strong>, <strong>probiotic</strong> and <strong>post-biotics</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="so-whats-the-bacteria-inside-of-you">So what’s the bacteria inside of you?</h1>

<p>Here is the thing. It’s not only bacteria inside your gut. There are</p>

<ul>
  <li>Viruses</li>
  <li>Fungi</li>
  <li>Parasites</li>
  <li>Archae (recently discovered) as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these micro-organisms make up your “Gut Microbiome”. Your intestines are a home to an ecosystem to these small organisms and they feed off the food you eat and rely on the warmth on the warmth that your body generates. Quite a smart place to call home.</p>

<h1 id="what-do-they-do">What do they do?</h1>

<p>Humans can’t digest fibre. I am sure you have heard at some point that fibre is good for you but that is weird given that humans can’t naturally digest fibre. But guess who can?</p>

<p>The gut microbes.</p>

<p>The gut bacteria breaks down fibre and releases <em>Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)</em>. (They have nothing to do with being fat)  SCFAs are fatty acids with fewer than 6 carbon atoms.</p>

<p>The three most common are <strong>Acetate</strong>, <strong>Propionate</strong> and <strong>Butyrate</strong>.
These SCFAs play crucial roles in the body¹:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Acetate</strong> is important for energy production and synthesis of lipids</li>
  <li><strong>Propionate</strong> is mainly involved in producing glucose in the liver and small intestine</li>
  <li><strong>Butyrate</strong> is the preferred energy source for cells that line the colon.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="why-is-they-are-important">Why is they are important?</h1>

<p>To answer this, I think it’s easier to highlight the bad things that happen if we don’t take care of our gut microbiome.</p>

<p>Your intestines are very selective about what they absorb into the body. There are also some harmful things produced by the gut bacteria such as <strong>bacterial endotoxin</strong> which is not harmful when it’s in the intestines but harmful when it gets into the blood.</p>

<p>Butyrate as mentioned above, is the preferred energy source for cells that line the colon. Butyrate is formed from fibre that you eat. It follows that if you eat less fibre, you are eating less of what your intestinal lining needs to stay closed and not feeding the bacteria that form butyrate.</p>

<p>What this leads to is inflammation of the intestinal lining and entrance of bacterial endotoxin into your blood. Leading to inflammation is all of the wrong places in your body.</p>

<p>In addition to that, inflammation in your intestines may lead to colon cancer and other nasty health complications.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-keep-our-gut-microbiome-happy">How to keep our Gut Microbiome happy</h1>

<p>Fibre.</p>

<p>That’s it.</p>

<p>Foods that have fibre are plant based. That is</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fruits</li>
  <li>Legumes</li>
  <li>Vegetables</li>
  <li>Seeds &amp; Nuts</li>
</ul>

<p>I do realise however, that this is largely the Zimbabwean diet. From sugar beans to nuts. So I suppose that much of the nation is okay in terms of the gut microbiome. But it’s this second part that is more important.</p>

<h2 id="foods-that-affect-the-gut-microbiome">Foods that affect the gut microbiome</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Artificial sweeteners.
  Those found in “diet-drinks” and other similar foods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Processed/Refined foods.
  These deserve an article on their own. But they are more damaging than nutritive to the body and the gut microbiome is not spared.</li>
  <li>Red meat.
  Seems like beef isn’t responsible for gout only but can also affect your heart and gut.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="prebiotics-vs-probiotics-vs-postbiotics">Prebiotics Vs Probiotics Vs Postbiotics</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Prebiotics</strong> are plant fibers found primarily in foods that contain complex carbohydrates, like resistant starch and fiber. They act as food for bacteria, promoting their growth and health. Foods rich in prebiotics include whole wheat, bananas, soybeans, and greens. Essentially plants</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Probiotics</strong> are live bacteria and yeast contained in cultured foods. They promote healthy digestive function, support immune health, and influence overall wellness. Probiotic-rich foods include yogurt and kombucha.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Postbiotics</strong> are byproducts of the good bacteria left behind when probiotics ferment prebiotics. They contain dead bacteria, short-chain fatty acids, and peptides that support bodily function</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This was not at all exhaustive on the topic of gut microbiota. But I believe that if you were at zero, you now know to spare a thought for the 38 trillion strong army inside your gut.</p>]]></content><author><name>Tanaka Mawere</name></author><category term="Health" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Explore the world of gut microbes with me plus why fibre is very important!

But first a few disclaimers are in order.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Health tips isn’t as reductionist and simple as blogs (like mine) and people make them seem. There’s much more nuance to each point and more explanation that could be given but since we are living in a society of people with short attention spans, we try to package the most correct information possible in the shortest possible way.</li>
  <li>I am a medical student aggregating information from numerous studies and experts in different fields.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="1-exercise-will-remove-your-belly-fat">1. Exercise will remove your belly fat</h1>

<h3 id="misconception">Misconception</h3>

<p>Numerous studies from 2023 and prior have long since disproved what might be a very common assumption that if you exercise, you can lose weight. Very well meaning people often advise their peers to do situps or run so that they lose weight because it makes sense on the surface.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that exercising doesn’t contribute to weight loss and losing belly fat. It does.</p>

<p>But I have seen so many people frustrated with exercise because they don’t see the value of exercising after losing only a few grammes and no change to their body shape and “that tummy”. It’s all because they have it wrong.</p>

<h3 id="the-truth">The truth</h3>

<p>The single biggest contributor to weight loss is diet. More people are getting to know this more and more by the day.</p>

<p>If you eat more than you are burning through exercise, you are going to stay in the same place and feel stuck.</p>

<p>It’s also much less about the quantity you are eating and more about <strong>what exactly you are eating.</strong></p>

<p>Quality over quantity. To use a very extreme example, you could eat 2kg of fruits vs 500g of fast food and the fruit will invariably be better for you due to the way it’s absorbed and metabolised in the body.</p>

<h1 id="2-sleep-is-for-the-rich">2. Sleep is for the rich</h1>

<h3 id="misconception-1">Misconception</h3>

<p>As a university student in Zimbabwe, there’s a common phrase. “Arara akera” meaning “if you sleep, you will repeat a course”. It’s a way to say that to pass your courses, you need to stay up long nights studying.</p>

<p>And even outside of schooling, people don’t really see the importance of sleeping for as long as possible and having sleep of the highest quality.</p>

<h3 id="the-truth-1">The truth</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has considered adding ‘not sleeping enough’ to the list of things that cause cancer.</p>

    <p>This is because a lack of sleep reduces the number of immune system cells called “Natural Killer Cells” which do what they say on the tin. They kill any cell in your body that decides to become cancerous, protecting you from cancer.</p>

    <p>Hence reducing the number of those guys isn’t a good idea.</p>
  </li>
  <li>A recent discovery was that our brains go through a clean up process <em>when we are asleep.</em> Dead cells inside the brain and waste products from metabolism are cleared from our brains efficiently when we sleep for long enough and sleep well.</li>
  <li>
    <p>This one is for students. Neuronal connections are made when we are asleep. When are bodies drop dead while we are asleep, our brains are a hive of activity during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep and non-REM sleep which are the two phases of sleep.</p>

    <p>These neuronal connections account for creativity, awareness but more importantly, <strong>memory retention</strong>. Sleeping is essentially hitting the save button in Microsoft Word, but just in the brain. And yet we encourage students to do the opposite, not sleep so that they remember things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Lastly, a lack of sleep is linked to weight gain and inflammation due to throwing off hormones off their rhythm. For example, cortisol is a hormone that is released in different quantities due to the time of day. As such by not sleeping well, you throw off the natural clock you have and find yourself being much sicker due to the immune suppression cortisol causes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Summary of it all. Sleep is extremely important and we should skimp on it or compromise its quality.</p>

<h1 id="3-calories-in-calories-out-cico">3. Calories In, Calories Out (CICO)</h1>

<h3 id="misconception-2">Misconception</h3>

<p>The last conception on the list today is CICO, the Calories In, Calories Out phenomenon. What nonsense it is.</p>

<p>The idea is that eating 500 calories of bread for example, and eating 500 calories of nuts are the same. Because it’s still 500 calories after all.</p>

<p>People count their calories so that they watch what they eat. It’s especially done in weight loss programs and specialised diets.</p>

<p>It doesn’t help that the food industry has created this model just so that we are more okay with drinking Fanta with a hypothetical 400 calories just as much as eating an apple with the same amount of calories.</p>

<h3 id="the-truth-2">The Truth</h3>

<p>Different foods are absorbed differently in the body. The differences especially come from the way they are ingested.</p>

<p>For example, a fruit probably contains a lot of natural sugar yes, but it also contains fibre. And what fibre does is it creates a net of sorts, that lines your intestines and prevents more sugar and more sugar from being absorbed. Hence from maybe 10 grammes of natural sugar in a fruit, probably 6 grammes are absorbed because of fibre preventing excessive absorption. (Hence why fibre is good for you.)</p>

<p>Contrast this to fruit juice that may contain the same amount of sugar but is completely devoid of fibre. Hence all the 10 grammes of sugar are absorbed unapologetically leading to increased weight. Hence why fruit juice, which may seems healthier than Coke and other soft drinks, is essentially just as bad.</p>

<p>The point is a calorie just isn’t a calorie because of how different foods are absorbed. But advertising has led us to believe otherwise.</p>

<h1 id="bonus-point">Bonus Point</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Be very wary of foods that are advertised as “nutritious” and “healthy”. Normal human nature. If I told you I was a billionaire, the fact that I am telling you that I am one is a red flag and should show you that I am trying to cover up something.</li>

<p>Well, 5 April seemed to be too far of a stretch and I am right back to YouTube. I haven’t been binging it though as much as I used to but it’s still not April.</p>

<p>I didn’t make that resolution with enough conviction and believe in it enough. Besides, I had a good reason, ish. Problem is I have now forgotten what that reason was and I am back on the bandwagon.</p>

<p>YouTube is still blocked on my laptop and it’s only on my phone. It’s hard for me to zone out on my phone unlike my laptop where I am supposed to be productive.</p>

<p>The point was to establish a good relationship with YouTube. And I am happy with how it is right now. Blocked on my laptop but still there on my phone. The break I had helped to find a way to use YouTube in a way that is fine for me.</p>

<p>However, I am still wondering what I will do with WhatsApp. That’s probably for 2024 now.</p>]]></content><author><name>Tanaka Mawere</name></author><category term="Battle with Social Media" /><category term="YouTube" /><category term="Productivity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a good reason to go back (we always have a good reason.

<p>A week doesn’t seem like a long time but considering that a day wouldn’t pass without me typing “you…” and having the browser auto-predict that I want to open the land of milk and time-wasting that is YouTube, it really is something! Something that wasn’t easy at all.</p>

<h3 id="friday">Friday</h3>

<p>All the other days of the week, I was definitely fine. Until Friday.</p>

<p>And this is because usually on Friday afternoons, I open up my YouTube and watch videos till the evening. (Yes, my Friday afternoons are quite drab. It’s not a competition). So on the Friday I didn’t have YouTube, I really felt it. It being withdrawal symptoms.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t know the intensity of withdrawal symptoms that people who have had a drug addiction go through but I am sure they are almost the same as what I felt on Friday.</p>

<p>I felt a sense of something missing, a longing for YouTube, to just open it. I didn’t have an idea of what I wanted to watch. I just wanted it there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is in the moment that I realised that yes, YouTube (and social media) really is addictive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I distracted myself by relying on my other nemesis…</p>

<h1 id="whatsapp">WhatsApp</h1>

<p>Yes, I haven’t watched YouTube in a week but my usage of WhatsApp shot up. Not dramatically but significantly, especially for someone who already thought I spend more time than is necessary on Zuck’s messaging app.</p>

<p>I was really conscious about simply replacing the YouTube addiction and misuse with misusing WhatsApp which is my other enemy and I sort of failed in that.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s not a 1 to 1 match for the time you will spend. For example, WhatsApp, once you are not in conversation with no one, you can easily close the app unlike YouTube which presents to you more eye candy in the form of attracting thumbnails and videos once you refresh the page.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>I have been more productive in a way. Finally began to make progress on a project of mine and started being a bit more intentional, but I am definitely not where I want to be.</p>

<p>As for WhatsApp, it’s another battle that I have commenced. I am experimenting with a few things to see healthy ways to still have WhatsApp in my life. I will probably have to outline why WhatsApp is a problem to me because I have just realised that some people might not understand why I don’t like WhatsApp so much.</p>

<p>I left social media, or at least a part of it, in 2021 completely. Reasons are for another article.</p>

<p>My Facebook account that I had opened in 2009 was deleted. The Instagram account that I had built quite a following on same thing. Twitter? Got the axe as well. I remember also having SnapChat and deleting it a week later too.</p>

<p>Overall, what was left was WhatsApp and YouTube. And these two were easy to excuse.</p>

<ul>
  <li>WhatsApp =&gt; My school sends updates through groups so I can’t possibly remove it?</li>
  <li>YouTube =&gt; I watch educational content only such as videos on coding or fixing stuff. In any case, with the time I am using on YouTube I am still being productive.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-problem">The Problem</h1>

<p>The problem however is that I have long believed that since I deleted social media (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook; the classics), I had more time to be productive. And by productivity, I mean actually study more or do the things that I really want to do.</p>

<p>But on closer inspection, I am no different to someone who has 10 social media apps on their phone and changes between each app. I really just replaced the time I thought I was saving with spending it on WhatsApp and YouTube, all because they are both easy to excuse as not wasteful.</p>

<h1 id="focusing-on-youtube">Focusing on YouTube</h1>

<p>I will tackle WhatsApp later. YouTube is really what forced me to think about this and write it down.</p>

<p>I take pride in that I never got onto the TikTok, Reels or Shorts train. Because short videos take advantage of our short attention spans and make them even shorter. So I always watch long form content on YouTube, usually videos lasting 9 minutes or more. And because most of the videos I watch are educational, I am able to <em>rationally</em> justify spending 2 hours watching video after video after video.</p>

<p>But truth be told, I have a growing discontent internally for the following reasons</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Time wasting
 When you have something hard to do, it’s very easy to open a browser, type “you..” and let auto-predict direct you on your way to watching videos. And the YouTube algorithm is so good that it’ll recommend video after video after video, and in no time, you have spent 3 hours on the site.</p>

    <p>This in particular hurts studying time and time meant to be working on projects that actually matter in the real world…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Motivation depletion
 I haven’t looked for studies to back this up hence all this is personal experience. 
 I have noticed that stopping to watch YouTube while stuck in a YouTube rabbit hole is hard. Extremely hard. You get into a state of being tranced into waiting for the next video to give you a dopamine hit. 
 And even when you manage to snap out of it, you don’t feel particularly excited or motivated to be productive. You are just there, feeling like a wasteman.</p>

    <p>I really don’t know what it is about social media that after using it, you feel sort of depleted and tired. And YouTube was doing that to me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Asking myself what I just watched</p>

    <p>I got into an exercise of asking myself the importance and relevance of what I just watched to my life. Okay, I now know what “Clean Architecture” is but where does that apply to me? It is educational, but relevance is zero.</p>

    <p>The times I really like is when I end up watching a Beta Squad video. Now let me take the time to say this PSA</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>If you don’t know what the Beta Squad is, I envy your life and the focus you have in it. Keep it going.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Anyway, I don’t know what relevance or particular importance it is to me to see Chunkz guess African’s ethnicity based on their language. So why should I watch it? Thing is I don’t do it willingly. I end up <em>there</em>. And that’s just an effect of being tranced into a social media consumption rabbit hole.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="seeing-it-for-what-it-is">Seeing it for what it is</h1>

<p>Given the reasons above and how negatively YouTube is beginning to impact my life, I had to call a duck, a duck because it was quacking like a duck. YouTube is making me not focus on the things I want to achieve, it’s wasting time, makes me feel like a wasteman, gets me stuck in 2 hours watching cycles and more importantly, it’s really hacked my dopamine system.</p>

<p>And even the times I justified YouTube as being productive, is it really? And asking myself that question led me to thinking and believing that I left social media, only to get addicted to YouTube, which is a form of social media in itself.</p>

<h1 id="the-plan-now">The plan now</h1>

<p>Going cold turkey on YouTube until 5 April. (Close to my birthday)</p>

<p>Typing this, I feel unsure I can accomplish this since YouTube is a mainstay of my daily living. But it’s a necessary challenge in which I will question if YouTube really is that important and try to prove to myself that I can live without it.</p>

<p>I am going to be very very bored hence I will end up writing more nonsense like this on my website to not make me go crazy. By the way, if you got this far in the article, could you kindly send a ‘😝’ emoji <a href="https://wa.me/263785468923">to my WhatsApp</a>. I’d appreciate it.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, my school group (8 of us) had patient case presentations. It was a Friday and given the vibe of the day of ‘I want to get this over with so that I go back home and vegetate on some TikTok’, each of us wanted to go present first and leave the hospital. No one wanted to go last so in my head, I had no problem with being the ‘sacrificial lamb’ that waits. I had no problem with it until someone said, “you should go last because you usually have no problem with it.”</p>

<p>I don’t know what it was but it felt like a switch was flipped in my head to just be antagonistic. It was saying “I was okay with going last on my own volition but since you said I should, I don’t want to anymore.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am sure we all relate to how you could wake up one morning, feel like you could do the dishes, sweep the floors and even mop the ceiling. UNTIL, until your mom tells you to do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s like all the internal motivation you had to do something just vanishes out the window and you get into a “I don’t want to do it anymore” type of mode.</p>

<h3 id="we-are-all-rebels">We are all rebels</h3>

<p>There is a certain part in us all that just doesn’t want to be told what to do. Certainly in me, being hard and strong headed is a trait. So knowing this about humans, what do you do when you want to communicate with your peers effectively or write something?</p>

<h1 id="dont-tell-cause-thought">Don’t tell, cause thought</h1>

<p>I was really trying to think of a catch statement do distill all this. “Don’t tell, cause thought” sounds grammaticaly correct but I am not settled with it😂. But it will have to make do. And it’s really self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Don’t tell people what to do. We don’t want to be told what to do. Instead, lead people to think for themselves. No wonder there is the over-reliance on the not-so-common ‘common sense.’ We expect individuals to get to certain conclusions using ‘common sense’ (but of course it’s not so common) and that’s how people want to be treated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People love freedom and autonomy. The best feeling is doing something because you did it because <em>you wanted to</em>. Not because you were told to.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Hence as a communicator, speaker or ‘content creator👀’, aim to present the facts in a way that enables people to get to their own conclusions. Cross your fingers that <em>if whatever you are saying makes sense</em>, people are also going to get to the same conclusion as well.</p>

<p>And if they feel like they are forming their own opinion or conclusions without you being instructive or pushy, it’s much more likely to see people respond positively to you.</p>]]></content><author><name>Tanaka Mawere</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="Productivity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[People don't listen when you tell them something.

<p>I recently went into a shop that sells good quality clothes. Thing is I don’t go for shopping. I will go 5 years without buying a clothing item just because I don’t like going shop by shop looking for clothes.</p>

<p>Then it hit me.</p>

<p>Why not make an app for this? For lazy people like me to do their clothes shopping online?</p>

<p>Then it hit me again.</p>

<p>My girlfriend’s WhatsApp has close to 30 groups of people who sell clothes in there (I don’t like them because they might hide a chat from a blesser or someone she’s cheating with when I am doing my daily check ups on her phone.) Add to that, the use of Facebook Marketplace.</p>

<p>And just like that, the Zimbabwean Amazon died before it went anywhere.</p>

<h1 id="its-everywhere">It’s everywhere</h1>

<p>And if you think about it, there are WhatsApp groups for everything, not just clothes. Food, cars, books, movies (ehm ehm). In first world countries, there are separate apps for each category.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just for food in first world countries, Chicken Inn, Nandos and kwaMereki would have their own separate food ordering apps. No wonder there are more jobs there than here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything is in WhatsApp. So as a developer trying to remove people from WhatsApp, natural question to ask is “why?” Why is everything aggregated in WhatsApp groups?</p>

<h1 id="to-state-the-obvious">To state the obvious…</h1>

<p>It’s convenient. Simply that. I already have a WhatsApp bundle to stalk my relative’s status updates who recently left Zimbabwe and isn’t sending money back home but is going on holidays to what’s it called, Bhali, Balie? So why not just look for clothes in the same app by just joining groups?</p>

<h1 id="data-is-expensive">Data is expensive?</h1>

<p>A few years ago, you would have convinced me that it was because data is expensive and people just buy WhatsApp bundles. Which is still true to some extent. It’s more likely for someone to have a WhatsApp bundle and not a data bundle in Zimbabwe. But I don’t buy this reason completely.</p>

<p>The number of people now using Instagram and more ubiquitously, TikTok, makes me think that of course, not everyone has money for data bundles, but if someone is using their data for TikTok, they have probably 5mb to spare for using a different app.</p>

<p>Granted the number of people who use TikTok in Zimbabwe, is still low compared to the total population but I suppose with time, they will increase. Which lead me to…</p>

<h1 id="time">Time</h1>

<p>I don’t know what the solution is for developers to pull the population away from WhatsApp to their apps but something tells me that with time and as more and more people are digitally connected in Zimbabwe, this is likely to change. Because for all their merit, WhatsApp groups are limited.</p>

<p>There is a lot of spam eating into your device memory. You can’t really search for a product and of course, payment systems. It’s a hassle that I suppose people in Zimbabwe in a few years will be ready to eliminate.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>But what do you think? Are there any actionable steps to pull people away from WhatsApp groups towards using dedicated apps or websites? Because WhatsApp really is a developer’s enemy and developers need to fight against it.</p>

<p>The number of times I have cast my privacy-disrespecting eye over to someone’s phone (most often a dude) and he passes through his apps screen, chances are I see Metatrader 4 and/or 5. And if you don’t know Metatrader 4 or 5, you are either a girl or a pocketically-blessed dude.</p>

<p>The subject matter I want to talk about doesn’t need you to have any forex trading knowledge because I will keep it as generic as possible. So let’s dive into the catch of forex trading.</p>

<h1 id="an-egg">An egg…</h1>

<p>Ever heard the statement that the hardest thing to cook is an egg? And it’s because so easy to cook. Doesn’t make sense right?</p>

<p>We are used to eating eggs that are either overcooked or overcooked-er. They are always way to crispy on the outside if they are fried, some to the point of qualifying as biltong. Worse even, try making a sunny side up egg without browning the edges. What about boiling an egg without making the york into a rubbery, minature ‘zadza-dama’? I won’t even mention poaching.</p>

<p>The point of the overly-drawn joke above is that making a perfect egg is hard because the way to make an edible egg is easy to understand and do. It’s just frying in oil, boiling in water etc. That’s simple. The barriers to making an egg are so low and that’s what makes it hard. Contrast that with making a <em>insert some complicated recipe I will search on Google that only Gordon Ramsey can make</em>. The fact that you need the skills of Gordon Ramsey to make it stops you from even daring to make it.</p>

<h1 id="so-what">So what?</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Forex trading is like making an egg.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s so easy to put in $10 to start trading with. All you need is to make a broker account, download Metatrader and start getting your losses because you probably have no idea what you are doing. The barriers of entry into forex trading are extremely low hence anyone can sign up to do it.</p>

<p>Much like making a perfect egg, the average Joe who has entered into forex trading will fail. And does fail. No wonder you hear so many people saying “forex trading is a scam” or something to that effect.</p>

<p>And I don’t blame people for signing up to trade. All the other potential <del>legal</del> ways of making money either need some skill, quite a bit of capital and more effort than that which is required in forex trading. 
But that ease of entry into trading is also the downfall for many and it is the catch.</p>

<h1 id="the-effects-of-the-catch">The effects of the catch</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Trading, like any other business, needs capital. - More likely than not, if you deposit any amount below $100, you are going to lose it because when trades are still in red, your capital can’t handle it. And for you to make sensible money from such a low amount, you’d have to over-leverage your small capital (essentially trading more than you can). So in the end, you’d be at a disadvantage.</p>

    <p>I never understood it while starting out while some brokers said their minimum deposit amount was $500. But now that I have gained the experience I have, anything below $100, you are probably going to lose it. This is another blog post on it’s own explaining this more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no selection criteria - You just can’t be a doctor. There are many exams over the 5+ years of training that make sure you are up to scratch with your skills and knowledge to treat patients.</p>

    <p>Not with trading though.</p>

    <p>The only person stopping you from risking all you own is you. No one evaluates your skills and knowledge about trading or the market prior to trading except you. Hence anyone who wants to trade, can. And that is ultimately bad for them as they will end up blaming the markets for their lack of experience when they lose everything.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Side note though. People go get degrees so that they trade for big banks and sometimes fail to make profits even with tens of millions of dollars to trade with. What makes us think that watching YouTube videos for a weekend and armed with $10 of capital, we are going to buy a Ferrari and lift the whole family out of poverty?</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="the-take-aways">The take-aways</h1>

<p>I wish all brokers had $500 as their minimum trading amount. I was angry about it when I started learning how to trade but it helped me not lose more than I did as I was learning. And it’s only from losing money that I learnt this lesson, hard. If someone asks me for advice on trading, I immediately tell them that if they don’t have $500 or more to trade, leave it alone.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>While I understand that trading might seems like a low-cost option of a side hustle, because it’s so easy to get into now, that should not be mistaken for ease of execution. Starting to forex trade is easy. Forexing <em>trading</em> itself, a totally different beast on its own.</p>

<p>I am currently reading Stephen Bartlett’s “Diary of a CEO: 33 laws of something (I have forgotten and lazy to check it up)” and there is a chapter that says Plan B is bad for Plan A.</p>

<p>That whole chapter resonated with me. Imagine you were living in a shack and you had one opportunity to free yourself and your family from poverty. You’d work hard to make that opportunity worthwhile and if you don’t succeed as much, you will be close to some definition of success. However, if you have an alternative path to follow, you won’t work as hard on Plan A because Plan B is a safety net for. Hence the commitment, the almost deluded belief in Plan A will not be there as you have comfort of having another way to go.</p>

<p>Hence you won’t execute plan A well or fail miserably at it.</p>

<h1 id="my-story">My Story</h1>

<p>I have seen this in myself. My plan A is to make something with my coding skills and have that sustain me. My plan B is doing this medicine thingy. But because medicine is a safe bet and comforting, I am putting nowhere enough effort in plan A that would make me succeed at the very least. I suppose that if I wasn’t enrolled into medical school and sitting at home (of course not with African parents), plan A would probably be all there is and I would put all my being and effort into it.</p>

<p>But because plan B exists, I am calm when I am not supposed to be.</p>

<h1 id="this-is-zimbabwe">This is Zimbabwe</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>But that is the Zimbabwean story isn’t it? One thing can’t sustain you. You have to have a job, a side hustle, a farm and three Visa applications to go to the UK, Australia and/or Poland (in that order) to help old white people bath.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So realistically speaking, it’s not bad for plan B to exist. In Zimbabwe, it’s a necessity even. But there is a need to be conscious of your priorities and what you want to achieve most so that side-plans do not derail the first one.</p>]]></content><author><name>Tanaka Mawere</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having a 'Plan B' is bad for 'Plan A']]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1498654077810-12c21d4d6dc3?q=80&amp;w=2070&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1498654077810-12c21d4d6dc3?q=80&amp;w=2070&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">My current experience with impostor syndrome</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/thoughts/2023/11/03/impostor-syndrome.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My current experience with impostor syndrome" /><published>2023-11-03T18:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-11-03T18:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/thoughts/2023/11/03/impostor-syndrome</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/thoughts/2023/11/03/impostor-syndrome.html"><![CDATA[<p>I suppose being a late teenager and getting into your twenties, you go into life with so many ideas of how things are supposed to go, how things are etc. After all, your life before university is almost as black and white, wrong and right as it can get. You are either a good student or a bad student, you are either a good child or a bad child, you are either a good friend or a bad friend. You get the idea. But then you get to experience life in its whole, I believe in university. You start to appreciate that life is not black and white but many many shades of grey.</p>

<p>That’s what happened to me this year. I was never scared to share information with people. I’d read dozens of books a year, listen to many podcasts and read many articles on how to be the best person I could be (I still do). I would then share this information. That was one of my motivations to start this blog, to have a place to share things I found interesting with people around me, hoping it’d help.</p>

<p>However, events that have happened this year, many that I caused to myself, have led me to question myself more. And it has led me to question <a href="https://tanakamawere.co.zw/thoughts/2023/10/29/by-whose-authority">who am I to say anything that I say?</a> I suppose this is still me reeling from the events of this year and I will eventually get back to feeling like myself and writing regardless.</p>

<h2 id="it-really-doesnt-matter">It really doesn’t matter</h2>

<p>I have had plans to start a podcast for at least a year now and I will. I wanted to start it as a podcast to give advice and lessons that I have learnt from my very short life, especially to young, Christian boys. But again, the question springs up. Who am I to do that? The point of the podcast has now changed then. Instead of me giving advice (which I don’t have anyway), let me talk to people who are way ahead of me. Doctors, parents, pastors etc, people who obviously know something about life because I know nothing.</p>

<p>In summary, it’ll be a podcast where I selfishly talk to people who are way ahead of me in life and ask them questions that I have. I’ll be learning and hopefully, you’ll be learning too.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I wrote this today so that I am keep a public record of me going through impostor syndrome for the first time in my life and seeing how I will overcome it. Typing this, I am now questioning if ‘impostor syndrome’ is a problem anyway.😂 Maybe it’s a way for people to know their places in life.</p>

<p>But I will go back to my past cadence of posting things I would have found interesting. That shouldn’t cause any problems since the information wouldn’t be coming from me directly😂. And when the podcast comes around, it’ll be even better.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Key takeaway for me: I am not old enough to be giving ‘life advice’. Don’t I ever will or dare to.</p>
