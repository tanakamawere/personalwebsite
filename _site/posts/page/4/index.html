I have recently started my clinical rounds in medical school and seeing patients for the first time. When I see a patient’s condition, I wonder to myself if it could have been avoided with a healthier lifestyle i.e. regular exercise and stress management.

However, these thoughts are immediately stopped by reality. Try convincing an overweight mother from Glen View or Budiriro to wake up and chase the wind for 30 minutes every morning. Never going to happen.


  What I hope is that since you are in a position to read this, you are much easier to convince.


So listening to the podcast, it was interesting to learn that humans sweat out the stress hormone (called cortisol) when exercising.

I have always known that to exercise the mind, exercise the body and the vice-versa but this was a new perspective.


  What this means essentially is that when you exercise, you are literally sweating out the stress hormone thereby reducing your stress levels.


Another tidbit from the podcast

In a study to show the power of our minds, weightlifters who imagined themselves lifting weights in their minds had the same muscle growth as those who actually lifted weights.

This is a whole other discussion on its own that is interesting as it delves into the realm of visualising stuff. But that’s for another day.

Conclusion

If you have gotten this far in the post, please send this emoji ☺️ to my WhatsApp . I appreciate it.

You want to make your business to be talked about more. You want your posts to be shared more and reach more people. The following are practical principles you can and should include in any marketing campaigns or business ventures.


  S - Social Currency
  T - Triggers
  E - Emotion
  P - Practical Value
  P - Public
  S - Stories


The above 6 principles abbreviated STEPPS explain why some things are ‘contagious’. And here is a summary of each point.

1. Social Currency

People share information or are more likely to tell their friends about something if it makes them look cool, smart, funny etc.

What value will it give person A for them to share your business or information with person B? Will it make them look more informed, in the loop?

Takeaway: The more the social currency sharing information has, the more it will be shared.

2. Triggers

Ever noticed that any time there is a family gathering, there is always a Coke? Coke always advertises with good family vibes and having a good time.

Family vibes have now become a trigger for us to think of making the moment better with a Coke.

Takeaway: Aim to associate your business with something that customers come across everyday e.g. when you brush your teeth every morning (if you actually do), you think of Colgate. If you think of Aquafresh, side eye.

That way, that particular thing becomes a trigger for customers to have your business in mind all the time.

3. Emotion

This point isn’t directly related to business but it relates more to what I am doing now, writing, content creation etc. 
And it is fairly simple to explain.

And we have a fairly recent example. Covid Pandemic.

People would share that which invoked the most fear or the most hope, regardless of whether it was factually true or not.

Takeaway: Either make people extremely sad or extremely happy. (Just not angry)

4. Practical Value

Of what use is this article to you? Well, I hope you get some insights into what makes sharable information more sharable. That’s the practical value that I hope that you reading till here will give you.

Takeaway: Make your business, content give practical value to the customer. As long as it is solving a pain point and giving value, it will be contagious and spread like wild fire.

5. Public

The more public something is, the more likely people will imitate it. Design products and initiatives that advertise themselves are more likely to stay at the minds of users creating what Berger called Behavioural Residue.

6. Stories

Aren’t humans sucker for a good story? We communicate in stories and stories stick more than raw facts and points.

Takeaway: Create a narrative or story that people want to tell which carries your idea along for the ride.

And as I was researching his life, I came across the following, got excited, thought of something I would share this with on a Friday afternoon. No one came to mind (obviously) so here it is on my blog post that you and 5 other people will read.

Just read what this military man did as an African president.


  He sold off the government fleet of Mercedes cars and made the Renault 5 (the cheapest car sold in Burkina Faso at that time) the official service car of the ministers.
  He reduced the salaries of well-off public servants (including his own) and forbade the use of government chauffeurs and first class airline tickets.
  He opposed foreign aid, saying that ‘He who feeds you, controls you’.
  He spoke in forums like the Organization of African Unity against what he described as neocolonialist penetration of Africa through Western trade and finance.





  He called for a united front of African nations to repudiate their foreign debt. He argued that the poor and exploited did not have an obligation to repay money to the rich and exploiting.
  In Ouagadougou, Sankara converted the army’s provisioning store into a state-owned supermarket open to everyone (the first supermarket in the country).
  He forced well-off civil servants to pay one month’s salary to public projects.
  He refused to use the air conditioning in his office on the grounds that such luxury was not available to anyone but a handful of Burkinabés.
  As President, he lowered his salary to $450 a month and limited his possessions to a car, four bikes, three guitars, a refrigerator, and a broken freezer.


Oh wait, there’s more


  He was known for jogging unaccompanied through Ouagadougou in his track suit and posing in his tailored military fatigues, with his mother-of-pearl pistol.
  When asked why he did not want his portrait hung in public places, as was the norm for other African leaders, Sankara replied: “There are seven million Thomas Sankaras”.
  An accomplished guitarist, he wrote the new national anthem himself.


He was no saint, by no means. But no one can deny that this man was an African president cut from a different cloth to what we have now.

It is unfortunate though that he was assassinated in 1987 by the same man, Blaise Compaoré, who had helped him get into power in 1983. Blaise Compaoré then took up power and ruled Burkina Faso as a dictator until 2014.

  I don’t believe in majority rule ever in Rhodesia… not in 1000 years.


But if you then read the whole paragraph…


  I have said before, and I repeat, we are prepared to bring black people into our Government to work with us. I think we have got to accept that in the future Rhodesia is a country for black and white, not white as opposed to black and vice versa. I believe this is wrong thinking for Rhodesia. We have got to try to get people to change their line of thinking if they are still thinking like that. This is outdated in Rhodesia today. I don’t believe in majority rule ever in Rhodesia… not in 1,000 years. I repeat that I believe in blacks and whites working together. If one day it is white and the next day black I believe we have failed and it will be a disaster for Rhodesia.


And hasn’t Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) been a disaster for the past 43 years?

There is a lot to shame Ian Smith for. But this isn’t one of them. Our independence as highlighted by the August 2023 elections have just served to prove the last white prime minister right.

                    <span class="reading-time-estimate" data-content="1. Read what is relevant to you in the moment

One mistake I did when I started reading books is reading a book just because it was popular. Even if the book is popular and actually good, because you are not in the space that the book will resonate with you, it will end up being a drag to read.

In the times that in your life you are concerned about money, read more books to do with finance. Or when you are concerned about your health and fitness etc, make sure your reading list is catered to that in that moment.

You will find yourself wanting to read the book even more and actually get to finish a book you have started.


  Another thing that is linked to this point is to not read for people. Read what you enjoy and what aligns with your current goals and purpose. What that you read will manifest itself to the right people, if you are so inclined to impress people with what you read.


2. You are allowed to skip pages

I had the belief that for me to have finished the whole book, I should have read every single word, paragraph and page, even the parts I found dull and monotonous.

This point is especially true when you are reading one of those cheesy self-help books I detest. Some parts of them are great to read and you should, but some parts are mushy and repetitive. Skip that. Jump to the next chapter, paragraph, whatever.


  Get to what you want to read and what you want to know to keep the book interesting to you


3. Write notes

Okay.

You’ve heard this before so I won’t waste time here. Writing notes is important so that whatever insights you get from reading, they immediately get imprinted in you head.

Microsoft Word is popular. Everyone has it. But this is Zimbabwe, so if you are not working for a company listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, you’re probably a pirate if you are using Microsoft Word. It’s not free. It’s supposed to be paid for.

I also released an app called Medbase. A few people use it and it makes me negative thirty dollars a year. But it’s a passion project so I keep it running. Point is though, it’d really suck with the effort I put in the application, someone removes the ads that bring a bit of money (that I haven’t even used because it’s not a lot) or someone does something to jeopardise the application. So since I also I have an app in the wild that I wouldn’t want to be tampered with, I don’t use Microsoft Word that is also tampered with.

But Microsoft is a big company

I know what you are saying,”Microsoft is a big company that brings in millions per year. My single laptop wouldn’t change a thing.” And I am genuinely against that type of thinking. Because guess what, you are not the only one thinking that. A million other people in Zimbabwe are probably saying the same and that compounds.

I relate it to my application. If Medbase was charging $5 a month to use and it had 100 people who had the same thinking, that means Medbase wouldn’t be making $500 per month that is was supposed to make. And in Zimbabwe, that is a lot of money that can support the creator of the app and also be invested back into the application.

The world is going digital

Everything in life is becoming digital. Unfortunately, as Zimbabweans we don’t see value because we are used to physical, tangible things. So paying for something digital is a waste of money (money that many Zimbos don’t have anyway) but it’s a mindset that will have to change eventually as we go into the future. Paying for digital services is a reality that we can’t run away from because it is coming.

And since I fall into the category of Zimbabweans who can’t afford to pay for Office, I’d rather use the free alternatives such as LibreOffice and FreeOffice just because of how I wouldn’t want to not make money from my own app too.

Conclusion

This was a hodge podge of a post but the summary is this. I feel the pain of not getting renumerated on your hard work. And I hope that Zimbabweans get used to paying for digital programs.

Any long time readers of my blog posts would have noticed that the website has changed more times than Mai Titi has changed husbands. That is because in all the previous versions of my website, I wanted to take short-cuts and use templates created by someone else. I tried avoiding creating the website from scratch (because “time”. Just laziness to be more accurate) but all the templates really quite didn’t do it for me. So I did the natural thing to do in such a situation.

_I gave up._

Well, until now. Came back, guns blazing determined to create my website from the ground up. I was going to put a portfolio, pagination, a game, my own design philosophy and another thing that would have been completely unnecessary. And it burnt me out. In just a day, I wanted to have everything that everyone else who has a personal website was doing.

The Lesson I Learnt

In start-ups, there is something called a “Minimum Viable Product” (MVP). It means having the basic functionality of some thing to work although it doesn’t have everything that you want it to have. With time, you can start adding those bits and bobs  that you left out at first offering.

That’s essentially what this website is. It’s far from done in my own estimation but it does the basic function of what I want it to do. Which is to let me talk about things that no one cares about. And with time, I will add to the other things that I want to add that may not be as important.


  This is the bit I hate that I have to say something inspirational, a take home message so that you don’t feel like you have wasted time reading this so here goes nothing.


Don’t wait for things to be perfect to start. Start with the minimum you have and iterate on it over time.


  That felt cringe to say.
Anyway, thanks for reading. 
If you got this far, you deserve a star.
