# Why Doctors Exist

I have long wished for doctors to be more preventative than curative. To prevent disease more than treat it only because it's now present. I then realised over the christmas period, that there are other people who have that job of being preventative. Nutritionists, food scientists and health advocates among many other professions, are the ones who are supposed to be preventative, not doctors. So each to his own. And I made my peace.

Of course I didn't make my peace with it. 

I then thought that why, on average, doctors are more important (in the public social eye) and why they earn more than people who train to prevent disease. And it's got me lying on the floor, typing away on my laptop on New Year's day about why this is interesting.

# Hypertension & Diabetes Mellitus

There are chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM). I hate them particularly because they are so avoidable. Granted, there is a subset of people with genes that predispose them to getting the disease *more easily* than others. But numerous studies and literature has shown that certain genes are only activated **due to what we do and how we live.** But that's another conversation for another day. 

Hypertension and DM are in a way, a sentence to always being on pills for the rest of ones live (not so much with hypertension). And that alone is something that a person who has lived his/her entire being pill free (except for the occasional Flumel, who hasn't taken that?) wouldn't want to start in midlife or old age. Add on top of that, the complications of these two diseases.

- Stroke
- Blindness
- Kidney disease (and those are important)
- Heart failure 
- Maybe throw in an early death due to the complications? Just for good measure

It would make sense that someone knowing this would steer away their life from a path that leads to hypertension and diabetes. No one attempts to overtake a motorcade because we know the consequences are painful and probably lethal. 

But nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. 

# Let's cross that bridge when we get there

Before I continue, I should say something important.

> I am not interested in health so that I live 100 years. I have no control over that. A car might hit me tomorrow or I might watch another game of Chelsea playing and die on the spot. (I have more chances of living with the former scenario). The point is _health span_, not _life span_. I'd rather live 30 healthy years than 50 miserable years in a wheelchair, if that makes sense. 

We gamble with our health _when we are healthy_ because we'd rather deal with a problem when it's here, not when it's imaginary like a chronic disease you might or might not get in the future.

And this makes absolute sense. We devote our brain power towards problems of the present moment.

# Conclusion

So what's the point of me writing this? 

Well, it's a new year for the gamblers. We all gamble with something everyday and most worringly, we gamble with our health when it's the foundation of everything else in our lives from being able to work, to being able to play real life "Temple Run" in the CBD around election time.

This isn't supposed to be a post on pushing people to be healthy.

It was simply to appreciate how we gamble with the future in the false hope that health will continue endlessly just because it's here right now.

> So happy new year to us, the gamblers🍻🍾🥳
