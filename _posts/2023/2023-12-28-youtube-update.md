# I needed it for something

Well, 5 April seemed to be too far of a stretch and I am right back to YouTube. I haven't been binging it though as much as I used to but it's still not April. 

I didn't make that resolution with enough conviction and believe in it enough. Besides, I had a good reason, ish. Problem is I have now forgotten what that reason was and I am back on the bandwagon. 

YouTube is still blocked on my laptop and it's only on my phone. It's hard for me to zone out on my phone unlike my laptop where I am supposed to be productive. 

# Try, try, try again

The point was to establish a good relationship with YouTube. And I am happy with how it is right now. Blocked on my laptop but still there on my phone. The break I had helped to find a way to use YouTube in a way that is fine for me.

However, I am still wondering what I will do with WhatsApp. That's probably for 2024 now.
