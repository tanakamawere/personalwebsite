It really is heartbreaking seeing people on hospital beds at Pari due to diseases that are easily avoidable in old age if people are health conscious in their youth.

Problem is we think we have time so "_I will start eating better, exercising later_"

Another thing is seeing fruits and yoghurts next to the beds... If you ate more of them before, you wouldn't be here.
