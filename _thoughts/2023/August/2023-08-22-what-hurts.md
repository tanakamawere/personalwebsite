I think what hurts the most is that reading history, you see how prosperous Zimbabwe once was.
The breadbasket of southern Africa. The Zimbabwe dollar being stronger than the rand, almost equal to the USD. Having one of the strongest economies in Africa.

I don't want to romanticise the past as if everything was perfect though. It's just a thought.
