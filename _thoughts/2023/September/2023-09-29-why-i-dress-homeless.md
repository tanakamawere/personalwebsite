Why I dress like a homeless person and like someone who doesn't care about his appearance is _I can't pretend to look good outside when I know I'm not good inside_.

There is very little good in me considering the weight of sin I carry. Why spend hours in the mirror trying to look good outside? That's hypocrisy!
