I feel old when I realise that most of my age mates don't share the same nostalgia as me in tech. 

Very few remember back in 2008/09 when 3G was still new. And there was no hotspot as we know it, so to connect a laptop to the internet, you'd have to use a 'dial-up' connection and 56kbps was blazingly fast.
