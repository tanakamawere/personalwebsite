"If you want to be a grocer, or a general, or a politician, or a judge, you will invariably become it; that is your punishment. 

If you never know what you want to be, if you live what some might call the dynamic life but what I will call the artistic life, if each day you are unsure of who you are and what you know, you will never become anything, and that is your reward."

*Oscar Wilde*
