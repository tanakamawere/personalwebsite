I ended 2023 and started 2024 in a bad way. I felt **condemned** for the sins I had committed, things I never thought I would ever do in my life. 

But that was wrong. 

Satan *condemns* (makes you think there is no hope for you, continuously makes you live in guilt, steals your joy, it hurts, it burdens)
While God *convicts* (Gives you a clear enough path to move towards repentance, conviction gives you *hope* that you can do better)

> Proverbs 24:16 KJV
    For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: But the wicked shall fall into mischief.

So despite the past, I wake up today (and you should too) with the hope that this is the day I finally defeat sin. If not today, then tomorrow. If not tomorrow, then the day after. 

Never be defeated by sin and lose conviction.
