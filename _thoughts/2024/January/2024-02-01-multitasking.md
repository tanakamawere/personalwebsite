There is no such thing as **Multi-Tasking**

[Conclusive evidence](https://www.apa.org/topics/research/multitasking) shows that what you are doing is "Task Switching" i.e. switching your attention repeatedly among the tasks you are doing.

Multitasking may seem efficient on the surface but may actually take more time in the end and involve more error.
