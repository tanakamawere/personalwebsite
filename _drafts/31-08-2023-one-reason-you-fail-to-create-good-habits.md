# You don't have a plan

And that's really it.

Everyone wants to exercise, start reading and/or wake up early and people then tell themselves that "tomorrow, I will exercise". Tomorrow comes, nothing. 
And I have done that numerous times personally.

Similar to schools, whatever you want to do productively needs a syllabus. Something to tell you what you are going to be doing and when. Otherwise, the time is going to come and go that you want to exercise, study or read something without you doing anything because you simply didn't know how you were going to do it.

> Plan the how (what's the first, second, third step), the what (what exactly you will be doing), the when (time to do it).

# Conclusion

Obviously, there is more nuance to understanding why we aren't productive. Another reason is making sure why you want to be productive matters to you. And it's a multi-step process and this is one thing that I thought would be useful to work on. Have a plan.
